==== Mouse Driver ====
A simple driver for any PS/2 mouse that supports Microsoft Intellisense 
emulation (you can read this as "any mouse from the last two decades")

The mouse packets for an intellisense mouse are packets consisting of 3 bytes:
1. info byte:  Yofl Xofl Ysgn  Xsgn ONE mdl rgt lft 
                 7     6   5     4   3   2   1   0
x relative offset byte: 8 bit unsigned value
y relative offset byte: 8 bit unsigned value
z offset byte: 4 bit signed value of the magnitude of the scroll

The x and yrelative offsets plus the sign bit from the info packet can be used to
obtain a signed 9 bit value for offsets (-256 to 255).

I could not find much information on the overflow bits except that if they are
set then the mouse packet is probably bad and should be ignored.

A click can be detected by looking for a difference in the desired mouse button
in the info packet between two successive packets (a switch from 1 to 0 means
it went from a pressed to unpressed state, the opposite switch means

For exact details on the initialization see mouse.c and mouse.h in the 
src/drivers/mouse/ subdirectory.

The mouse buffers packets in a circular buffer similar (read: identical, mainly
so that I could use a pre-existing datatype that I already had) to the one used
by c_io.
