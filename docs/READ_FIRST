To run the operating system type the following commands in the src directory:

make clean
make all
cd kernel
make <target drive>

Since the make files worked in the first place, getting them to work perfectly 
was a slight oversight.


There are a number of additional options which may be passed to build system
	release - Builds no debugging code
	debug - Include special debug only features, this is on by default
	no_vesa - Disables vesa code 
	no_net - Disables scanning for the intel 8255x network card, allows booting on machines without this card.

For example to use these additional build options run the following from the src/ directory:

make clean
make all debug no_vesa no_net
