SCREEN DOCUMENTATION
Author: Benjamin Mayes

Usage:
handle_t openscreen()

Description:
Opens a new screen handle that can be used and abused by this process. After
using this system call the process can use the setscreen system call to set its
screen to the new screen.

WARNING: The process is expected to call closescreen on the handle afterwards.

Return:
Upon successful execution, a handle_t with a value >= 0 will be returned by the
function. If the handle_t is < 0 then it should be creatively reinterpreted as a
status_t.
