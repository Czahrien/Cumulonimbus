SCREEN DOCUMENTATION
Author: Benjamin Mayes

Usage:
handle_t switchscreen( handle_t newscreen )

Description:
Sets the main screen to the given screen.

Note that in most cases you only want to switch to the current process' screen 
so it will recieve input from after the switch. There are some situations where
this may not be the case though so the user can specify the screen.

Return value:
Upon successful execution, the old screen handle will be returned. If execution
fails then a negative value that should be creatively reinterpreted as a 
status_t is returned.
