Various user level processes that emulate how a user may use the screens system
for testing screen functionality.

screen_user_a: opens a screen, closes it immediately after 
screen_user_b: gets and sets screens, opens and closes them.
screen_user_c: allocates all available screens then closes them in reverse
               order
screen_user_d: sleeps for a few seconds, switches to a screen for a few seconds
               then switches back to the original screen
