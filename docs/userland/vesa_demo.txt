To initially test the VESA driver I wrote a few graphics demos. I only left
the ones that were most complex in the operating system. The code for these
demos were from before we had the baseline operating system.

void print_hue_test();
    Prints a hue test on the screen to verify that hues are working correctly.
    This demo shows that colors are created correctly and show off the marvels
    of having thousands of colors (16 bits).

void print_mandelbrot( double param );
    The Mandelbrot demo that everybody has seen. Somehow this demo, despite its
    simplicity, generates extremely complex images that show off the "power" of
    the driver.

void print_julia( double param, double cx, double cy );
    Similar to the Mandelbrot demo but more interactive.
