This program takes a text file as its command line argument.

The text file should first contain two whitespace separated integers. These 
specify the size of the font. After this up to 256 characters can be 
specified in the following format:

n

(n can be specified in any desired order)
(where each of the width*height xs contain a 0 or 1 meaning no-color or white)
